Recommended exe build tool: cx_Freeze

Other tools I tried did not work. PyInstaller does not appear to support multiple python file packaging (but it may
work if the files are all combined into one). py2exe supports multiple Python files, but does not support Python
3.5.x (should work with 3.4, though, if that were used).

To build a Windows executable from this project, it should be enough to run python.exe setup.py build, if python.exe is
on the path (otherwise replace python.exe with the path to Python). This project was tested with Python 3.5.2, but
it probably should work with a different recent Python 3.x with minimal changes.
