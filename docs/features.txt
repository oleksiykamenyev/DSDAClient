TODO?
random demo
 - no clean way to get a list of all demos I think, won't do
   - figured something out for this, will do
get biggest time difference between 1st and 2nd places across DSDA
 - probably will be a one-time script that I run whenever I feel like coding it
percentage of record runs
 - too long to parse so many wad pages, won't do
ignore ".wad" when querying wads - DONE
add substring search for wads
  - would probably not be too useful due to the number of wads, won't do
    - never mind I'm doing it
change input() to input(' >') - DONE
autocomplete or short command versions - DONE
 - autocomplete would break Windows because readline is not Windows-compatible :\
handle Keyboard Interrupt exceptions - DONE
    try:
        user_query = input('> ')
    except EOFError:
        exit('')
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print()
    else:
    ...
handle short map numbers for Doom 1 wads and short episode notation (ep1 or e1), probably all for D[12]ALL as well
return number of demos during an update
  - return new players and wads during an update
    - there ends up being too many wads, so I don't think it's worth it
